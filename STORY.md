Eren, lives with his mom in a small village near forest and river, in Africa. Every other day, he catches fish on his boat, and sells it to collectors. He struggles with hearing random noises in his head under stress. On leisure Eren meets up with his old friend Pelin to talk about everyday life, and health.

Day 1: (Introducing mechanics, and world)
It starts to rain on the beach on a Wednesday afternoon, where Eren is taking care of his boat. He rushes to cover the boat. He can't find the boat cover, swearing to his luck, picks up his blade and chops some branches for cover. As it rains heavier, he accidentally slits his arm, gets his clothes all covered in blood.

Applies the first aid kit on his boat and goes back home. Finds his mom is sleeping.  

1 Week later: (The big event)

Eren spends the rest of the week at home in leisure. Finally it's sunny on Monday, he takes his boat to fishing. His net full of fish, he returns relatively happy, until he beaches his boat. He discovers an abandoned body washed up into shore. As he turns it face up, body bleeds through it's stomach revealing a glass bottle inside it.

> So it was alien 

That's what is written on the note. Dazzled by the mystery, Eren leaves the body and runs to the authority to notify.

Eren makes a decision to tell them about the note or not.

Authorities tell him to go home and rest. Eren makes a decision to either go home or return back to the beach to collect the fishes.

Upon going home, Eren finds his mom talking with a local. He goes straight to bed and sleeps.

Upon returning to beach, Eren finds the authorities investigating the body. They don't allow him near his boat. Eren goes home, he finds his mom drinking tea, joins her, they talk about future and weather.

Next day, authorities find Eren and show him his blade and ask about the wound on his arm. Eren can't explain clearly because he can't remember anything.
